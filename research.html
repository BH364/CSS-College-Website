<p>Original research is the guiding force for quality of academics in a university and RGUKT adopts an academic culture that involves a mix of teaching and research towards maintaining a high order of quality of education.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate carrying of research which is effective, significant, useful, and cater to the needs of the society in a more meaningful way RGUKT defined some important areas of high societal relevance as those of institutional research focus and would encourage its faculty, PhD and other students to channelize their research and make significant contributions in the same. The researchers are expected to collaborate with other colleagues and carry on complimentary research towards solving problems of a large magnitude and in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>The thrust areas of research identified include, Nano-Technology, Green technologies, Water, Energy, Information systems, Information security, Wireless communications, Next generation internet, Computational - x, Implementation of major projects of public interest, Health Care, Intelligent manufacturing, Biomaterials, Technologies for the rural and unorganized sectors and Education science and technology, besides others.</p>
